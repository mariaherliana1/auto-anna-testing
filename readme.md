# Auto-anna 

This script takes in two CSV files, merges them, and outputs a new CSV file with combined data from both tables.
It also standardizes date-times into ISO format, and cleans phone number formats.

## How do you turn this on: 
- Open your favorite terminal window.
### First run
- Install `conda` in your system. 
- Create your Python environment `conda create --name auto-anna`.
- Activate your python environment `conda activate auto-anna`.
- Install dependencies. `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Every other run

- Activate your python environment `conda activate auto-anna`. 
- Open the `config.py` file and update the csv file paths. 
- Run the python script. `python auto-anna`.

#### Hope this helps :)
